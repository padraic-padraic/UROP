\section*{Stochastic Theory}
A Stochastic Variable is another name given to a Random Variable, a key component of probability theory. Random Variables take on a value from their Sample Space of possible values with a probability given by their probability distribution or density function. The word stochastic, from Greek, means 'non-deterministic'; this reflects that it is not possible to predict with certainty what value the random variable will take; we can only give relative probabilities, and characterise the variable in terms of its distribution properties e.g mean.
